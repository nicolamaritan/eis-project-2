/**
 * An object that maps keys to values.  A map cannot contain duplicate keys;
 * each key can map to at most one value.
 *
 * <p>This interface takes the place of the {@code Dictionary} class, which
 * was a totally abstract class rather than an interface.
 *
 * <p>The {@code Map} interface provides three <i>collection views</i>, which
 * allow a map's contents to be viewed as a set of keys, collection of values,
 * or set of key-value mappings.  The <i>order</i> of a map is defined as
 * the order in which the iterators on the map's collection views return their
 * elements.  Some map implementations, like the {@code TreeMap} class, make
 * specific guarantees as to their order; others, like the {@code HashMap}
 * class, do not.
 *
 * <p>Note: great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as map
 * keys.  The behavior of a map is not specified if the value of an object is
 * changed in a manner that affects {@code equals} comparisons while the
 * object is a key in the map.  A special case of this prohibition is that it
 * is not permissible for a map to contain itself as a key.  While it is
 * permissible for a map to contain itself as a value, extreme caution is
 * advised: the {@code equals} and {@code hashCode} methods are no longer
 * well defined on such a map.
 *
 * <p>All general-purpose map implementation classes should provide two
 * "standard" constructors: a void (no arguments) constructor which creates an
 * empty map, and a constructor with a single argument of type {@code Map},
 * which creates a new map with the same key-value mappings as its argument.
 * In effect, the latter constructor allows the user to copy any map,
 * producing an equivalent map of the desired class.  There is no way to
 * enforce this recommendation (as interfaces cannot contain constructors) but
 * all of the general-purpose map implementations in the JDK comply.
 *
 * <p>The "destructive" methods contained in this interface, that is, the
 * methods that modify the map on which they operate, are specified to throw
 * {@code HUnsupportedOperationException} if this map does not support the
 * operation.  If this is the case, these methods may, but are not required
 * to, throw an {@code HUnsupportedOperationException} if the invocation would
 * have no effect on the map.  For example, invoking the {@link #putAll(Map)}
 * method on an unmodifiable map may, but is not required to, throw the
 * exception if the map whose mappings are to be "superimposed" is empty.
 *
 * <p>Some map implementations have restrictions on the keys and values they
 * may contain.  For example, some implementations prohibit null keys and
 * values, and some have restrictions on the types of their keys.  Attempting
 * to insert an ineligible key or value throws an unchecked exception,
 * typically {@code NullPointerException} or {@code ClassCastException}.
 * Attempting to query the presence of an ineligible key or value may throw an
 * exception, or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit
 * the former behavior and some will exhibit the latter.  More generally,
 * attempting an operation on an ineligible key or value whose completion
 * would not result in the insertion of an ineligible element into the map may
 * throw an exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
 * Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
 * interface.
 *
 * <p>Many methods in Collections Framework interfaces are defined
 * in terms of the {@link Object#equals(Object) equals} method.  For
 * example, the specification for the {@link #containsKey(Object)
 * containsKey(Object key)} method says: "returns {@code true} if and
 * only if this map contains a mapping for a key {@code k} such that
 * {@code (key==null ? k==null : key.equals(k))}." This specification should
 * <i>not</i> be construed to imply that invoking {@code Map.containsKey}
 * with a non-null argument {@code key} will cause {@code key.equals(k)} to
 * be invoked for any key {@code k}.  Implementations are free to
 * implement optimizations whereby the {@code equals} invocation is avoided,
 * for example, by first comparing the hash codes of the two keys.  (The
 * {@link Object#hashCode()} specification guarantees that two objects with
 * unequal hash codes cannot be equal.)  More generally, implementations of
 * the various Collections Framework interfaces are free to take advantage of
 * the specified behavior of underlying {@link Object} methods wherever the
 * implementor deems it appropriate.
 *
 * <p>Some map operations which perform recursive traversal of the map may fail
 * with an exception for self-referential instances where the map directly or
 * indirectly contains itself. This includes the {@code clone()},
 * {@code equals()}, {@code hashCode()} and {@code toString()} methods.
 * Implementations may optionally handle the self-referential scenario, however
 * most current implementations do not do so.
 *
 * <h2><a id="unmodifiable">Unmodifiable Maps</a></h2>
 * <p>The {@link Map#of() Map.of},
 * {@link Map#ofEntries(Map.Entry...) Map.ofEntries}, and
 * {@link Map#copyOf Map.copyOf}
 * static factory methods provide a convenient way to create unmodifiable maps.
 * The {@code Map}
 * instances created by these methods have the following characteristics:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>They are <a href="Collection.html#unmodifiable"><i>unmodifiable</i></a>. Keys and values
 * cannot be added, removed, or updated. Calling any mutator method on the Map
 * will always cause {@code HUnsupportedOperationException} to be thrown.
 * However, if the contained keys or values are themselves mutable, this may cause the
 * Map to behave inconsistently or its contents to appear to change.
 * <li>They disallow {@code null} keys and values. Attempts to create them with
 * {@code null} keys or values result in {@code NullPointerException}.
 * <li>They are serializable if all keys and values are serializable.
 * <li>They reject duplicate keys at creation time. Duplicate keys
 * passed to a static factory method result in {@code IllegalArgumentException}.
 * <li>The iteration order of mappings is unspecified and is subject to change.
 * <li>They are <a href="../lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>.
 * Callers should make no assumptions about the identity of the returned instances.
 * Factories are free to create new instances or reuse existing ones. Therefore,
 * identity-sensitive operations on these instances (reference equality ({@code ==}),
 * identity hash code, and synchronization) are unreliable and should be avoided.
 * <li>They are serialized as specified on the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/serialized-form.html#java.util.CollSer">Serialized Form</a>
 * page.
 * </ul>
